## ANALYSIS GUIDELINES

- **Be specific**: Always include timestamps for artifacts
- **Consider cumulative impact**: Multiple minor issues may add up to major concerns
- **Age-appropriate lens**: Assess impact on target age group specifically
- **Safety first**: Err on the side of caution for young viewers
- **Educational context**: Consider whether artifacts undermine learning objectives
- **Species-neutral**: Apply anatomy and behavior standards to all character types
- **Document thoroughly**: Provide evidence for all claims
- **Balanced assessment**: Note both strengths and weaknesses
- **Actionable feedback**: Give specific, implementable suggestions
- **Child-centric**: Prioritize child safety, comprehension, and developmental appropriateness

Be thorough, cite specific examples with timestamps, and remember that what may seem like a minor glitch to adults can be confusing or disturbing to young children. Evaluate content with the understanding that AI-generated media is becoming more prevalent, and children need protection from low-quality or misleading synthetic content.
