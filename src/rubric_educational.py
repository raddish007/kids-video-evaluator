## ANALYSIS GUIDELINES

- **Document only**: Report what educational content is present and how it's taught
- **No effectiveness judgments**: Don't assess whether teaching is "good" or "will work"
- **No age-appropriateness**: Don't determine if content matches specific ages
- **Factual accuracy**: Do flag incorrect information with evidence
- **Be specific**: Include timestamps for all observations
- **Count precisely**: Number of examples, prompts, repetitions, errors
- **Describe methods**: What teaching techniques are actually used
- **Neutral language**: "Video uses repetition 5 times" not "Video effectively uses repetition"

**Your role**: Document what educational content exists and how it's presented. Do NOT assess effectiveness, appropriateness, or make recommendations. That belongs in synthesis reports.

Focus on answering: "What is being taught and how is it being taught?"
